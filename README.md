I've worked in IT for years but never really taken the time to really learn programming 'til now. I've previously done a fair amount of shell scripting to solve simple problems and also worked with SQL/PL-SQL databases.

I'm finally taking the plunge towards really learning to code - mostly in python with an eye towards the very trendy AI/ML/Data Science realms.  I have an interest in understanding finance and markets, too.
