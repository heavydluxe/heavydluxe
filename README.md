- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @heavydluxe
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming - mostly with python.  I've worked in IT for years but never really taken the time to code 'til now.
- ðŸ˜„ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that will stretch me to learn.  I'm particularly interested in head-ier things like cellular automata, markets, datasci/ML/AI.  To be clear, I'm not saying I have those skills... Just that I'm interested in those things. Though, if you had a rad game idea, I'll listen!
