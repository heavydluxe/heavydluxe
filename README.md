Hi, I’m @heavydluxe

I’m currently learning programming - mostly with python.  I've worked in IT for years but never really taken the time to code 'til now.  I'd be interested in collaborating on anything that will stretch me to learn.  

I'm particularly interested in things like cellular automata, economics and markets, datasci/ML/AI.  To be clear, I'm not saying I have those skills... Just that I'm interested in those things. Though, if you had a rad game idea, I'll listen!
